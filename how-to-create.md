# Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Secure Password

## Step 1: Use at Least 12 Characters
Longer passwords are harder to crack. Aim for at least 12 characters.

## Step 2: Combine Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, and Special Characters
A mix of characters increases complexity.
- Example: `P@ssw0rd#123!`

## Step 3: Avoid Predictable Patterns
Donâ€™t use:
- Names or birthdays.
- Simple sequences like `12345` or `qwerty`.

## Step 4: Create Unique Passwords for Each Account
Using the same password for multiple accounts puts you at risk if one account is compromised.

## Step 5: Use Passphrases
Passphrases are memorable but complex. Example:
- `PurpleElephants!Jump47`

## Good vs. Bad Examples
**Good Passwords:**
- Xy!aZ78#Lpq9
- LoveCats!2023$

**Bad Passwords:**
- password123
- abcdefg
